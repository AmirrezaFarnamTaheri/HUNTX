# Dev Outputs

Auto-generated proxy config outputs, updated by each pipeline run.

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `proxies.txt` | Raw proxy URI lines (plain text, one per line) |
| `proxies.json` | Structured JSON with all proxy URIs fully decoded |

These files are committed back to the repo by the CI workflow after each run.

**Do not edit manually** — they will be overwritten on the next pipeline run.
